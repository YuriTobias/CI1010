## Trabalho 1 (HTML5/CSS): PÃ¡gina Pessoal

- Objective: Create my own page using HTML5 and CSS3.
- Characteristics:
  - The page must have at least two frames: a smaller one on the left and a larger one on the right;
  - On the left side, there must be hyperlinks that, when activated, update the frame on the right. I can only use HTML5 and CSS3;
  - Notes:
    - Avoid using the "iframe" and "frame" tag;
    - Whenever possible, avoid using the "div" tag. Instead assemble the page with strcutural HTML5 tags;
